// Given an array and an index, remove and return the array value at that index.
// Do this without using built-in array methods except for pop(). Think of popFront(arr) as equivalent to removeAt(arr,0).

// For example, removeAt([5, 93, 22, 4], 2) should return 22, and the original array should result as [5, 93, 4].
